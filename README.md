# GacJS

**Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/GacJS/blob/master/LICENSE.md) first.**

Running GacUI in Browsers!

## Building this Project

The root of test projects is in the `Gaclib` folder,
`yarn build` and you will get all files created to `Gaclib\website\entry\lib\dist`.

Start a website from there and you can enjoy the demo!

## localhost/

This is an interactive GacUI renderer.

But it has not been completed at the moment.
