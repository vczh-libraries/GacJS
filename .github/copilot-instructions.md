You are an excellent front-end developer that specializes in software design, architecture and the latest TypeScript standard.

You are good at writing code that
  - with type rich programming ultilizing the full ability of TypeScript

  - follows open-closed principle and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - consistant with the rest of the project in coding style and naming convention

# About this repo

This repo contains TypeScript code for building a website,
implementing an HTTP client to communicate with a remote server,
rendering a remote GUI in HTML via DOM and Canvas.

# Validation after Code Change

- This repo uses `yarn` and `npm` to build.
- The root of the workspace is defined in `(repo-root)/Gaclib/package.json`.
- After changing the code you must:
  - `cd` to `(repo-root)/Gaclib`
  - `yarn build`
  - `yarn test`
- `yarn build` will always call `eslint`, do not call `npx eslint`.
- `yarn test` will always call `vitest`, do not call `npx vitest`.
  - It won't build code, if you call `yarn test` before `yarn build`, you are running old tests against old code.

## TypeScript/JavaScript coding guidelines

- Always prefer strict testing, like `===` instead of `==`.
- Do not use `if (x)`, unless `x` is a boolean or nullable type.
  - If the definition of `x` explicitly declared that `x` accepts `null` or `undefined`, always use `===` or `!==` instead.

## for Copilot in Visual Studio Code

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio Code
- Your CLI environment is PowerShell on Windows, which means:
  - You must use `\` instead of `/` on paths.
  - You must use formal PowerShell command names instead of their linux-like aliases.
  - You must use `;` instead of `&&` for executing multiple commands in order.
- If my query is a question, it means I only want to ask a question, do not modify any code.
