# About this repo

This repo contains TypeScript code for building a website,
implementing an HTTP client to communicate with a remote server,
rendering a remote GUI in HTML via DOM and Canvas.

# General Instruction

- This repo uses `yarn` and `npm` to build.
  - My `build` will always call `eslint`, do not call `npx eslint`.
- The root of the workspace is defined in `Gaclib/package.json`.
  - Call `yarn build` in `Gaclib` to build the whole workspace.
  - If your working directory in the repo root, you needs `cd Gaclib; yarn build`.

## for Copilot in Visual Studio Code

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio Code
- Your CLI environment is PowerShell on Windows, which means:
  - You must use `\` instead of `/` on paths.
  - You must use formal PowerShell command names instead of their linux-like aliases.
  - You must use `;` instead of `&&` for executing multiple commands in order.
- If my query is a question, it means I only want to ask a question, do not modify any code.
